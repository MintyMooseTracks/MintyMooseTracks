- 👋 Hi, I’m Minty!
- 👀 I’m interested in learning all I can about coding, so that I can create games, websites, and more!
- 🌱 I’m currently just beggining to code, so any help would be amazing.
- 💞️ I’m pretty okay without a lot of collaboration (unless, of course, you are a mentor.)
- 📫 How to reach me? Well, I am not so sure yet.
